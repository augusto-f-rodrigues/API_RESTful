# API RESTful
## Learning how to build a API from zero
Hi guys 😁
This is a simple project that I made to learning more about API's REST, it's a simple communication using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) as backend server,
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to made request operations simmuling the client, [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) as database to get, post,
delete or update my datas and other funny and useful things like [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) and [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) 
to do nice console logs 👌.
